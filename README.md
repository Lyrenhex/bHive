## Quick Start
To use bHive, you must compile the client ("bee") and the server ("queen") separately.
This can be done by using uflash for pip3, or by compiling in the [micro:bit MicroPython editor](https://python.microbit.org/).

When you've flashed both your "queen" and "bee" chips, repeatedly press the A button on the queen to make it scan for connected clients to execute the given commands.

Pressing the B button will execute the current command.

## Style Guide
Use PEP8. You may ignore E266 and E501.
